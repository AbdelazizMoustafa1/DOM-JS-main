This project is a website, compromised of an HTML, a CSS and a Javascript files. 

Disclaimer: The project and source files were provided by Udacity, my role was manipulating the Javascript file, and updating the HTML and CSS accordingly, to provide the website with the required performance mentioned below.

The page has the ability to hold mutliple sections, any number of sections can be added in the HTML file having the same properties as the previous sections. Furthermore, the Javascript app will make a dynamic navigation bar based on the number of sections present in the HTML file. 

The navigation bar elements will fetch and use the  name of the data-nav tag inside the section element so to make it easier to know which section is which.

When clicked by the mouse button, the navigation bar item will scroll to its specific section.

The website has the functionality of identifying which section is being viewed in the given viewport. 

Both from the sections in the website page, as well as the navigatin bar at the top, will highlights with a different color (orange in the sample) when a given section is visible in the given viewport, which is successfully responsive to differen screen sizes and devices used to reach the website.
